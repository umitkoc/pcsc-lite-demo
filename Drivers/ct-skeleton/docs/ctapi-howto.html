<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Linux CT-API HOW-TO</H1>
<BR>
<P>
This document describes how to write a compliant CT-API smartcard reader
driver under Linux.  These drivers work with the PC/SC Linux Smart Manager
Resource Manager.
</P>
<BR>
<B> REQUIREMENTS </B>
<UL><P>
To begin writing your Linux CT-API you must be sure to have a working
communications port interface.  Currently MUSCLE supports serial
interfaces and serial code to use with your serial reader is provided.
Parallel readers and PCMCIA readers are not yet supported as of this
release but could easily be implemented to fit in the infrastructure.    
</P><P>
For readers to work with the CT-API and resource manager, they must
support several functions.  Although most readers support these functions
it is necessary that they work properly.  First, all readers must support
a power up and power down.  Second, a reader must be able to Reset all
ISO-7816-4 compliant cards and return a unique ATR supplied by the card.
Third, the reader must support card in and card out events.  This means I
should be able to test at any time the card status in the reader, whether
this be in, out, on, or off.
</P>

<B>GETTING STARTED</B>

<P>
To begin writing your ct-api driver you must obtain the specifications
sheet provided by the reader manufacturer.  Determine the type of reader
that you have.  Many readers are type pass-thru in that they react much
like a modem does on the serial port.  Pass-thru or "Dumb Readers" rarely
care what you send to them because they will generally pass it on through
to the card hence the name.  These readers are a bit more tricky to
support.  Many communicate events such as card in/out by setting a line
high on the port such as CTS.  They also work entirely on timing that is
set by the software.  To reset the card you may have to set a line such as
RTS high for a certain amount of time and then bring it low again.  These
type of readers generally don't support many commands but are very
dependant on software timings which can be difficult between platforms.
The other type of reader, "Smart Readers", receive the commands sent to
them and format them to send to the smartcard.  They also have
specified commands for doing resets and checking card status.  These are
generally easy to use because they just consist of sending bytes out the
serial port.  Some readers support both modes and the user can choose by
issuing a command to the reader.
</P><P>
CT-API is a card terminal API written by a few German and Deutch companies
to fullfill the requirements of some German healthcard issues.  The
importance of CT-API is that it strictly follows the "Keep it Simple"
guidlines.  Basically it allows the user to have three functions:
<BR>
<UL>CT_init( ....... ); <BR>
    CT_data( ....... ); <BR>
    CT_close( ...... );
</UL>
<BR><BR>
First, <b>CT_init()</b> is responsible to open a channel to begin communictation to
the card terminal ( smartcard reader ).  Basically all it needs to do is
interpret the second parameter given to it which is the port number and
call the correct function to open that port.  Currently on the serial
version if the application passes the port number as <b>PORT_COM2</b>, the
<b>CT_init()</b> will call the <b>IO_InitializePort(9600,8,'E',"/dev/ttyS1");</b>
It will then return whether the function was successful.
</P><P>
Second, <B>CT_data()</B> is responsible for opening a direct
communications channel with the reader or the card.  What makes the API so
useful, is that it is still quite low-level yet it gives me direct access
to the card and the reader without worrying about checksums or any
communications port issues.  It allows me to choose whether to talk to the
card or the reader by using what it calls SAD and DAD.  These are
respectively, source address and destination address.  By specifying the
destination you can choose whether you want the outgoing command to go to
the card (0) or the reader (1).  When you send the command you must
specify the length of the command and also the length of the return you
are expecting.  In my implementation, the reader passes back the size of
the return.  In this scenario the return buffer must be set to the MAX
size of return commands (~264 bytes on many readers).  This function
handles sending commands to the serial port and also receiving any data.
This function then returns whether it was successful.
</P><P>
Third, <b>CT_close()</b> closes the communications channel to the port on
which the reader resides.  It takes only 1 parameter, ctn, which is card
terminal number which will be explained more below.  This function then
return whether it was successfull.
</P><P>
On some card terminals, especially those which are pass-thru, it may be
impossible to send a command to the CT-API to control reader events such
as Reset, and Get Status.  For this, and also to make our lives easier the
<B>CT-BCS</B> standard was created.  CT-BCS, or Card Terminal - Basic
Command Set allows me to send a constant command to all reader's CT-API's
and make them perform the same operation.  Basically what is needed is an
interpreter within the <b>CT_data()</b> function.  For example on the
Schlumberger (r) Reflex 62 reader I have to send byte 0x64 to the reader
in order to perform a reset on the card.  For the Litronic (r) Argus 210,
a pass-thru reader, I have to set the RTS for 50ms and drop it back low
for another 50 ms.  How can I issue a byte represented command to do that
?  Wouldn't it be nice if I could issue the same command to both readers
and not have to worry about what really happens ?  CT-BCS takes care of
this.  For more information on CT-BCS please refer to the Docs/Specs page
on the MUSCLE website.  In CT-BCS it takes care of a few reader functions
such as:</P>

<UL><b>Request ICC</b> - Applies power to the reader and card.<BR>
    <b>Eject ICC</b> - Removes power from the reader and card and ejects the card
    if supported.<BR>
    <b>Get Status</b> - Gets the current status. Card in/out. Card power status.<BR>
    <b>Reset CT</b> - Resets the card and or terminal.<BR>
</UL>

<P>
There are also some other functions listed in the specification to take
care of card terminals with displays for showing text to the user and also
terminals which support some type of PIN authentication.  These don't have
to be currently implemented.  The functions above MUST be implemented
correctly in order to work with the smartcard infrastructure.  Please
refer to the CT-BCS documentation for more information.
</P><P>
When interpreting the incoming command in the CT_data() function you may
want to do something like this:

<BR><BR>
<b>if ( cmd[0] == 0x20 && cmd[1] = 0x11 ) {</b>
<BR><BR>

I currently only look at the first two bytes, class and instruction.  The
remaining three bytes allow for some minor user preferences to be added.
To make things easy you MUST:<BR><BR>

Assume on Reset CT (0x20,0x11) that if your reader supports both card and
reader reset, you will want to first reset the reader and then the card.
Otherwise, more importantly make sure this resets the card and ALWAYS
returns the full ATR no matter what.  You will also notice that
ICC-Interface (same as ctn), allows you to specify which reader you want
to send the command.  This is only done if your smartcard reader has more
than 1 reader built in.  Otherwise IGNORE this and always perform the
operations on the only reader.

<BR><BR>

Assume on Request ICC (0x20,0x12) that the power on the reader is off.
Power up the reader and card.  It is not necessary to perform a reset on
the card and don't worry about sending any data back such as ATR or Type.
Just verify the reader was turned on and return.

<BR><BR>

Assume on Get Status (0x20,0x13) that the upper level application is only
interested in card power status and card in/out status.  This function
returns 1 byte determining on the current status. 0 - represents there is
no card inserted.  3 - represents a card inserted but not powered.  5 -
represents a card that is neither inserted or powered (induced).  See
documentation for more information.  It is NOT necessary to provide CT
manufacturer data object for this is read from the configuration file.

<BR><BR>

Assume on Eject ICC (0x20,0x15) that the reader is currently on.  All you
have to do is turn the reader off.
</P>
<BR><BR>
<P>
Now that you have a good understanding of what the requirements are you
are ready to begin supporting your reader.  By clicking on the link below
you will be given a a skeleton CT-API.  This will include the
following:<BR>
<UL>Makefile - This will compile to a shared object.<BR>
    ctapi.h - The header file for your CT-API driver.<BR>
    ctapi.c - This will have all the functions defined.  The largest part
    of this is doing the <b>CT_data()</b> function.<BR>
    serial.h - The header file for my serial port library.<BR>
    serial.c - Functions defined for the serial port library.<BR>
    defines.h - Global defines.
</UL>
<BR>
You should really only have to fill in code in the ctapi.c.  Everything
else is implemented for you.  If you have a pass-thru reader you may have
to make some changes to the serial code.  This is also true if you are
writing a PCMCIA or Parallel reader.  If you will be implementing more
functions like checksum functions, place their prototype in the ctapi.c
along with the function.  I would like the header to only show the three
CT-API functions.

That should be it.  Please direct all other questions to the mailing list
if you are having any troubles.  Once implemented please send a copy of
the code to <A HREF="mailto:corcordt@cs.purdue.edu">corcordt@cs.purdue.edu
</A> to be tested and added to the distribution. Good Luck !!!!!!!!
